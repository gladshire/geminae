Pillars of design:

Experiences I want:

Writing:
  o Dreamlike vacancy
  o Visceral prose
  o History vague and muddied by folklore
  o Fading glory
  o Large world, open to free exploration
  o Duality is a universal axiom



Mechanics:
  o Fluid, non-threshold-based character development
  o Sills upgrade on a practice basis, not through spending skillpoints
  o Non-categorical character creation
  o Some builds are unviable, but allowance for range of combat approaches
  o Unique 


Experiences I don't like:
  o Pick-and-choose classes
  o Fantasy tropes
  o 







- Educated people have modern-day appliances (described in antiquated terms)
- Dynamic skill-based description of character in character menu
